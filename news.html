                      Developers can now integrate ChatGPT directly, using a
                      token-based pricing system, into a host of different
                      enterprise and end-user applications.
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      Microsoft is making the
                      <span class="underline">ChatGPT</span> AI large language
                      model available in preview as a component for applications
                      designed for the company’s Azure OpenAI Service, paving
                      the way for developers to integrate the large language
                      model into a host of different enterprise development and
                      end-user applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Microsoft appears to have had several users working with
                      this integration already, listing ODP Corporation (the
                      parent company of Office Depot and OfficeMax), Singapore’s
                      Smart Nation Digital Government Office, and contract
                      management software provider Icertis as reference
                      customers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Developers using the Azure OpenAI Service can use ChatGPT
                      to add a variety of features to applications, like
                      recapping call center conversations, automating claims
                      processing, and even creating new advertisements with
                      personalized content, among other things.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Generative AI like ChatGPT is already being used to
                      enhance Microsoft’s product offerings, as well. For
                      instance, according to the company, the premium version of
                      Teams can use AI to create chapters in conversations and
                      automatically generated recaps, while Viva Sales can offer
                      data-driven guidance and suggest email content to help
                      teams reach their customers.

                    <h3>Enterprise use cases for Azure OpenAI ChatGPT</h3>
                    <p>
                      Ritu Jyoti, IDC group vice president for worldwide AI and
                      automation research, said that the proposed use cases make
                      a lot of sense, and that she expects much of the initial
                      usage of Microsoft’s new ChatGPT-powered offering to be
                      internally focused within enterprises.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “For [example], helping HR put together job descriptions,
                      helping employees with internal knowledge management and
                      discovery — in other words, augmenting employees with
                      internal search,” she said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The pricing of the service works by tokens - one token
                      covers about four characters’ worth of a given query in
                      written English, with the average paragraph clocking in at
                      100 tokens, and a 1,500 word essay at about 2,048.
                      According to Jyoti, one reason GPT-3-based applications
                      became more popular just before ChatGPT went viral is that
                      the pricing from the OpenAI foundation dropped to about
                      $0.02 for 1,000 tokens.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      ChatGPT via Azure costs even less, at $0.002 per 1,000
                      tokens, making the service potentially more economical
                      than using an in-house large language model, she added.
                    </p>

                    <p>“I think the pricing is great,” Jyoti said.</p>

                    <p>
                      Microsoft appears to be operating the service with an
                      emphasis on responsible AI practices, according to Gartner
                      vice president and distinguished analyst Bern Elliot -–
                      perhaps having learned lessons from incidents where a
                      chatbot front end to Bing displayed strange behavior,
                      including a conversation with a New York Times reporter in
                      which the chatbot declared its love and treid to convince
                      him to leave his spouse.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      “I think Microsoft, historically, has taken responsible AI
                      very seriously, and that’s to their credit,” he said.
                      “Having a strong track record for ethical use and for
                      delivering enterprise-grade privacy is positive, so I
                      think that’s in their favor.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      That’s a key consideration, he said, given the concerns
                      raised by AI use in the enterprise — data protection and
                      contextualization of data sets, more specifically. The
                      latter issue generally centers on making sure that
                      enterprise AI are pulling answers from the right base of
                      information, which ensures that those answers are correct
                      and eliminates the “hallucinations” seen in more
                      general-use AI.

                        >research began years before this</span

                      Apple and Sony had begun developing
                      <span class="underline">wearable</span>,
                      <span class="underline">head-mounted video displays</span

                      see-through mode as well as video viewing with a clip-on
                      to block the background,” researchers claimed at the time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The products are expected to be state-of-the-art with 4K
                      OLED displays, advanced eye- and hand-tracking sensors,
                      motion-based controls, collaboration tools, and

                    <p>
                      With this in mind it is interesting that Cook took a trip
                      to visit Sony’s cutting-edge image sensor research
                      facility in Japan in December 2022. Sony will provide
                      Apple with state-of-the-art image sensors for this year’s
                      iPhone, so it’s reasonable to think those sensors will
                      power the dozen cameras that are expected in Apple’s V.1
                      mixed-reality headset.

                    <p>
                      We know the project is complex. Already, work towards
                      shipping these devices seems to be demanding
                      <span class="underline">
                        effort from across the company
                      </span>
                      with software, hardware, and services development
                      resources being poured into a project that Apple hopes
                      will become another significant product line.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We’ve also heard that while the ultimate aim is to produce
                      mixed-reality glasses that are thin and light like normal
                      spectacles, the product we’re about to experience won’t be
                      those. The first edition will be bulky and expensive, with
                      cheaper models expected in 2024-25 and a lightweight model
                      more like normal spectacles
                      <span class="underline">not expected until 2026.</span>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The Financial Times report suggests that the design team
                      wanted to wait until it was possible to ship the lighter
                      product, but was overruled by operations, who felt the
                      need to get a version-one product to market from which to
                      iterate.

                      In a move that highlights how the ongoing US-China chip
                      war is disrupting the global semiconductor supply chain,
                      the US is taking measures to address a gap in restrictions
                      imposed on Chinese server maker Inspur Group that leaves
                      US companies free to continue supplying Inspur’s
                      affiliates, of which there are dozens,

                    <p>
                      Inspur sells servers targeted at AI and big data
                      workloads, and does business worldwide, including in the
                      US, Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and
                      Asia-Pacific.

                    <p>
                      Earlier this month, the Biden
                      <span class="underline">
                        administration added 37 more entities </span
                      >, including Inspur, to a trade blocklist. The blocklist
                      includes companies to which US semiconductor makers and
                      manufacturers of chip-making equipments may not sell
                      products without special licenses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The companies were added to the blocklist for, “among
                      other activities, contributing to Russia’s military and/or
                      defense industrial base, supporting PRC military
                      modernization, and facilitating or engaging in human
                      rights abuses in Burma and in the People’s Republic of
                      China (PRC),” the US Department of Commerce said in a
                      statement.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The Biden administration, including officials at the
                      Commerce Department, is aware that the chip blocklist does
                      not specifically cover Inspur affiliates and is working to
                      close the gap, but that may take several weeks, according
                      to the <span class="underline">Bloomberg report</span>.
                      Until then companies including Intel, Nvidia, and Cisco,
                      among others, are free to trade with Inspur without the
                      need for a license.

                    <p>
                      Meanwhile, Inspur Electronic Information Industry, a major
                      unit of the Inspur Group, convened a board meeting this
                      week to change its home location from the address of its
                      corporate parent to a place which is about two kilometers
                      away,

                    <p>
                      The company did not cite reasons for the change, but the
                      decision was made just days after the US Department of
                      Commerce added Inspur Group to the trade blocklist, the
                      report added. Inspur Electronic Information Industry is,
                      however, a separate legal entity from its parent company
                      and is not currently on the blocklist.

                      With this in mind it is interesting that Cook took a trip
                      to visit Sony’s cutting-edge image sensor research
                      facility in Japan in December 2022. Sony will provide
