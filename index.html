                  Headlines about 'tech' layoffs abound, but the reports can be
                  misleading. While Big Tech companies may be letting workers
                  go, the layoffs aren't dominated by IT talent firings. In
                  fact, there are fewer IT workers than job openings — a lot
                  fewer.
